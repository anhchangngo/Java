1. `java LeapYear`:
   - This will execute the program without any command-line arguments.
   - The program might prompt the user to enter a year or provide a default value.
   - The exact behavior depends on the implementation of the `LeapYear.java` program.

2. `java LeapYear 1975.5`:
   - This will execute the program with one command-line argument, which is a floating-point number (`1975.5`).
   - The program might encounter an error or exception when trying to parse the floating-point number as an integer year.
   - The exact behavior depends on the implementation of the `LeapYear.java` program.

3. `java LeapYear -1975`:
   - This will execute the program with one command-line argument, which is a negative integer (`-1975`).
   - The program might handle negative years as valid input or display an error message.
   - The exact behavior depends on the implementation of the `LeapYear.java` program.

4. `java LeapYear 1975 1976 1977`:
   - This will execute the program with three command-line arguments, which are three integer years (`1975`, `1976`, `1977`).
   - The program might process each year individually or consider them as a list of years for some specific purpose.
   - The exact behavior depends on the implementation of the `LeapYear.java` program.

In summary, the behavior of the `LeapYear.java` program with different command-line arguments can vary depending on how the program is implemented to handle input and process the provided values.
